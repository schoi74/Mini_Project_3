# How census tracts are grouped in Baltimore City based on individual income, household income, incarceration rate, and employment rate?

## Background

Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Lorraine Mirabella [published an article](baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-choice-neighborhoods-hud-grant-20180719-story.html) on _The Baltimore Sun_ approximately two years ago about how Baltimore City's $889  million plan to transform "a swath of East Baltimore" was awarded $30 million federal grant, which included tearing down Perkins Homes public housing and moving residents to new housing. As they made new housing guaranteed, the city was optimistic about the redevelopment. As this is the right direction and had an optimistic start to "create the new mixed-income community" with projects that include "a new school, parks and services to help families and job-seekers, and officials", how are different neighborhoods grouped in Baltimore City? We will analyze the data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) to further look into how different parts of the city are grouped based on different population metrics.

## Business Questions

_How are census tracts in Baltimore City grouped based on individual income, household income, incarceration rate, and employment rate?_

## Data Question - Open Data

We'll use open data from one source:

- [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org): We will look into 4 different population metrics for a cluster analysis.

    i. Individual Income: Average annual individual income of 2014-2015
    
    ii. Household Income: Average household income for children of 2014-2015
    
    iii. Incarceration Rate: Fraction of who grew up in this area who were in prison or jail in April, 2020
    
    iv. Employment Rate: Fraction of who grew up in this area have positive wage earnings in 2015

## Data Question - Metrics

We will use Microsoft Excel to answer:

- __How are different tracts clustered based on the four variables?__ Applying Excel Solver operations for a cluster analysis on a database that is constructed with variable z-scores, and cluster categories. 

## Data Answer

### How are different tracts clustered based on the four different population metrics?

__Anchor__ 1 is a cluster of _slightly greater_ individual income, _slightly greater_ household income, _less than average_ incarceration rate, and _greater_ employment rate

__Anchor 2__ is a cluster of _less than average_ individual income, _less than average_ household income, _slightly greater_ incarceration rate, and _less than average_ employment rate

__Anchor 3__ is a cluster of _one standard deviation less than average_ individual income, _one standard deviation less than average_ household income, _more than one standard deviation greater incarceration rate, and way less than average_ employment rate.

__Anchor 4__ is a cluster of _more than two standard deviations greater_ individual income, _slightly less than two standard deviations greater_ household income, _one and a half standard deviations less than average_ incarceration rate, and _slightly more than one standard deviation greater_ employment rate.

Here, we see that The sum of minimum distance squared is 243.21 units. For 230 data points, I think it is safe to say that there is a fairly strong correlation for tracts clustered into these four groups, as there is an average of 1.057 distance squared units.

![alt_text](https://github.com/schoi74/how-census-tracts-are-grouped-based-on-population-metrics/blob/main/count_visual.png)

Here, we see that the census tracts are distributed in increments:

- Anchor 1: 87 tracts in a cluster with tract 24510270401 (Glenham-Belford, Baltimore, MD)

- Anchor 2: 73 tracts in a cluster with tract 24510060200 (Baltimore, MD)

- Anchor 3: 46 tracts in a cluster with tract 24510080200 (Broadway East, Baltimore, MD)

- Anchor 4: 24 tracts in a cluster with tract 24510020300 (Fells Point, Baltimore, MD)

Here, we can notice that there are relatively less tracts in the cluster of high income, low incarceration rate, and high employment than the tracts in clusters of lower income, higher incarceration rate, and lower employment rate. However, the cluster of slightly high income, slightly high incarceration rate, and slightly lower employment rate has the most tracts with 87.

The results that I expected were that it would be pretty evened out and I was surprised to see how relatively small the cluster of so-called "wealthy" is. As the dates of the data are all slightly different, it is difficult to have a realistic takeaway from the cluster analysis. To look at this analysis from the time before Baltimore city's plan of redevelopment, I think this data analysis fairly shows the status quo that the city was trying to resolve by providing new guaranteed housing with a new school, parks and services to help families and job-seekers, and officials. However, if the data were to be all up to date, I think this analysis makes a great reminder for the city to continue working on the redevelopment plan to provide better lifestyles for the ones in need of support. 

## Summary

- The findings show that there is a fairly strong correlation of tracts within their clustered groups.

- The numbers of census tracts in each cluster are not evenly spread out. The number of tracts in clusters of lower income, higher incarceration rate, and lower employment rate is higher than that in the cluster of higher income, lower incarceration rate, and higher employment rate. 

- Depending on how we interpret the data on the timeline, one can say that it is a great starting point for the city to redevelop parts of certain neighborhoods or that there still more work to do.

- If bigger data sample sizes were available for all these tracts and towns within Baltimore city, I think it would be helpful to even incorporate how these tracts are based on by metrics, such as high school graduation rate, percent staying in same tract as adults, or even household or individual incomes for natives and immigrants.

- If I were to manage the city plans to redevelop certain parts of the city to improve people's lives, I would either incorporate more variables to further reason why and how the tracts are grouped into these clusters or delve more into the causes of why employment rate, for example, is lower in some regions or clusters than others and some possible resolutions to alleviate the discrepancy.

## Step-by-Step Excel Analysis

1. Copy and paste all the individual data sheets for each variable onto different sheets of one Excel file.
2. Filter through the sheet of individual income out of the copied data sheets to only include tracts within Baltimore City.
3. Then, copy the tract number, town names, and individual income onto another Excel file that will be used for cluster analysis.
4. Use VLOOKUP to bring data for each tract for household income, incarceration rate, and employment rate.
5. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each variable column.
6. Then, determine the z-scores for each variable by using the function STANDARDIZE.
7. Create a separate table above the data with the chosen anchor points with their corresponding z-scores by using the function VLOOKUP.
8. Continuing to the right of the data table, calculate the distance squared to each anchor point by using the function SUMXMY2.
9. Calculate the mininum distance squared out of the four distance squared in the same row (same tract/town).
10. By using the function MATCH, determine the anchor number of the minimum distance squared of the row.
10. Calculate the the sum of the minimum distance squared.
11. Use the Solver analysis tool to conduct the cluster analysis calculations.
12. Add constraints in the Solver window.
13. Use the function COUNTIF to count the tracts in each cluster.
14. Create a bar graph that visualizes the number of tracts in each group.
15. Add chart title and axes titles to the chart.
